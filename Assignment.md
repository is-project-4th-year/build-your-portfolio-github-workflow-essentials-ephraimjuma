## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

List at least **four key concepts or skills** you learned during the Git crash course. For each one, write a brief explanation of how it helped you manage your portfolio project more effectively.

- **Pull Requests:** I have learnt how to make a pull request when trying to update a feature from a sub-branch into a main branch. They enable code review and discussion before merging changes
- **Branch Protection rules:** Is necessary in order to prevent force pushes and accidental deletion of important branches.
- **Merge Conflicts:** Can be resolved by editing the conflicting files locally and pushing the fixes.
- **Deployment:** The index.html is deployed.
